<%= @user.first_name %>,

Welcome to the Givey.org movement!  Givey is a social experiment designed to help us all find the 
most alruistic people on Facebook while learning a think or two about how we perceive others (and 
what they think about us!)

By now, you've hopefully completed the first round of Givey, had some interesting "alone" time 
thinking about your friends, shared with us what matters to you and hopefully contributed a little 
to the movement.  If not, please click on this link to finish round one:

If you have, make sure to share your personal referral link so that your friends can share what they 
think about your altruistic tendencies (if you have any :)).  Here is your link:

Hope you enjoy what we're trying to do and share the love.


Best,


Josh & Bill
