      %h1 Please help us find out how.

        Together, we're raising $25,000 to give to  
        = @game.winner.name.split(/\s/)[0] 
        to split among some amazing causes.*
        
      %h2
        We're only asking for $5 from each player, and have
        already raised $XXXX from Givey players just like you.
