        Awesome job so far.  We've got a solid lead on how altruistic your friends are
        %b but
        unfortunately we (and this includes you) seem to know very little about you.
      
      %p
        To proceed, you're going to have to ask your friends to visit Givey.org 
        so they can provide some insight on what they think about you.
      
      %p
        If you're as altruistic as we hope, your vote for what to do with the $5,000
        we've all contributed could become a reality.
      
      %h2.share Share Givey.org and we'll notify you via email as soon as enough of your friends have had their way with you.

        %p 
          Give them this URL to analyze you on Givey:
