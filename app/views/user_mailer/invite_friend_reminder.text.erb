<%= @user.first_name %>,

About a week ago you completed round one of Givey.org.  Unfortunately, you STILL 
don't have enough altruism scores for us to share what others think of you.

Several friends are required so that no one person can figure out who said what about who, 
but, once unlocked, will give you some insight into what others think of your altruistic 
awesomeness (or not).

To invite more friends to Givey, simply share the following link with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and email:

And remember, this is all for a good cause so please share the Givey love.



Best,


Josh & Bill
