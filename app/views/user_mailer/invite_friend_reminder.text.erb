<%= @user.first_name %>,

About a week ago you completed round one of Givey.org.  Unfortunately, you STILL 
don't have enough altruism scores for us to share what others think of you.

You only need a handful of friends to play Givey for us to report your scores. This 
is required so that no one person can figure out who said one but still give 
you some insight into what others think.

To invite more friends to Givey simply post, tweet or email the following link:

And remember, this is all for a good cause so please share the Givey love.



Best,


Josh & Bill
