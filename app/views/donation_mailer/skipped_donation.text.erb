<%= @user.first_name %>,

We wanted to share some QUICK facts about contributing to Givey.org:

1 - Givey.org takes NOTHING.  100% (minus credit card processing fees) will go to the non-profit with the most altruistic votes.

2 - <%="#{Donation.count+20} people already contributed over #{number_to_currency(Donation.total)}." %>

3 - You can contribute as much or little as you can afford.  We ask for $5, but if you only have a buck, please consider contributing.


Here is a direct link to contribute:

Thank you,

All Givey.org Members
