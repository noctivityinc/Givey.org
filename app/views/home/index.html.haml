            %b We show you three friends.
            %p
              We pick three friends and ask you a seemingly random question.  You pick the 
              most appropriate friend based on the question.
            
          %li 
            %b Every question counts
            %p
              Every question asked has an "altruism score" that helps us determine if the friend you 
              pick is more or less likely to, well, save the world.
            
          %li
            %b Your friends of friends play and we combine the scores
            %p
              Once your friends have been "scored" by other people you both have in common enough times,
              you and your friends can see what others (anonymously) think of them
            
          %li
            %b Join the movement
            %p
              Tell us about your favorite cause and why it matters to you.  Contribute $5 to hopefully 
              turn it into $5,000 if you score as the most altruistic person on the web.
            
          %li
            %b We hit five grand and turn over the keys
            %p
              Once $5,000 has been raised, we let the person with the highest combined altruism 
              score decide what to do with the money and start again.
