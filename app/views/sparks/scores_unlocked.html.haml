        Great Job!  You Can Now View Your Altruism Score
      
      %p
        Awesome job so far.  Since a whole bunch of your friends have already voted on you, we can safely display 
        what others have said. 
        
      %p
        Of course, since this everything is anonymous, we can only show you the questions where you were picked or not picked, but 
        not WHO did the picking.  Sorry :)
